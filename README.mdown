# Wordmove

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/welaika/wordmove/master/assets/images/wordmove.png)

Wordmove is a gem that lets you automatically mirror local Wordpress
installations and DB data back and forth from your local development machine to
the remote staging server.

**SSH** connections are fully supported, while [FTP support is planned to be discontinued](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/FTP-support-disclaimer) when new features will be introduced.

Think of it like Capistrano for Wordpress, complete with push/pull capabilities.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/welaika/wordmove.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/welaika/wordmove)

## Installation

That's easy:

```
gem install wordmove
```


## Usage

```
> wordmove help
Tasks:
  wordmove help [TASK]  # Describe available tasks or one specific task
  wordmove init         # Generates a brand new Movefile
  wordmove pull         # Pulls WP data from remote host to the local machine
  wordmove push         # Pushes WP data from local machine to remote host
```

Move inside the Wordpress folder and use `wordmove init` to generate a new `Movefile` and edit it with your settings. Read the next paragraph for more info.

See the wiki article: [Usage and flags explained](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Usage-and-flags-explained) for more info.

### Screencasts

* Push all WordPress, including database and uploads: http://vimeo.com/74648079
* Pull database and uploads, adapting paths and urls: http://vimeo.com/74646861
* Push only theme, transfer only modified files: http://vimeo.com/74647529

## Movefile

You can configure Wordmove creating a `Movefile`. That's just a YAML file with local and remote host infos:

```
local:
  vhost: "http://vhost.local"
  wordpress_path: "/home/john/sites/your_site" # use an absolute path here

  database:
    name: "database_name"
    user: "user"
    password: "password"
    host: "127.0.0.1"

production:
  vhost: "http://example.com"
  wordpress_path: "/var/www/your_site" # use an absolute path here

  database:
    name: "database_name"
    user: "user"
    password: "password"
    host: "host"
    # port: "3308" # Use just in case you have exotic server config

  exclude:
    - ".git/"
    - ".gitignore"
    - ".sass-cache/"
    - "bin/"
    - "tmp/*"
    - "Gemfile*"
    - "Movefile"
    - "wp-config.php"
    - "wp-content/*.sql"

  ssh:
    host: "host"
    user: "user"
```

We warmly **recommend** to read the wiki article [Multiple environments explained
](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Multiple-environments-explained) if you need multi-stage support, and the wiki article [Movefile configurations explained](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Movefile-configurations-explained) to understand about the supported configurations.

## Supports
### OS

OS X and Linux are fully supported.

See the [Windows (un)support disclaimer](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Windows-(un)support-disclaimer)

### SSH

* You need `rsync` on your machine; as far as we know it's already installed on OS X and Linux.
* if you want to use your SSH public key for authentication,just delete the `production.ssh.password` field in your `Movefile`. Easy peasy.
* writing the password inside the move file was and is somewhat supported, but we discourage this practice in favor of password-less authentication with pub key. Read [here](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/%5Bdeprecated%5D-SSH-password-inside-Movefile) for old informations.

### FTP

* You need to install `lftp` on your machine. See community wiki article: [Install lftp on OSX yosemite](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Install-lftp-on-OSX-yosemite)).
* Use the relative FTP path as `production.wordpress_path`
* Use the absolute FTP path as `production.wordpress_absolute_path` (you may need to recover this from the `__FILE__` [magic constant](http://php.net/manual/en/language.constants.predefined.php)
* if you want to specify a passive FTP connection add to the YAML config a `production.ftp.passive` flag and set it to `true`.

### Multistage

You can define multiple environments in your `Movefile`, such as production, staging, etc.
Use `-e` with `pull` or `push` to run the command on the specified environment.

For example:
```
wordmove push -e staging -d
```
will push your local database to the staging environment only.

## Notes
### How the heck you are able to sync the DB via FTP?

We're glad you asked! We basically upload via FTP a PHP script that performs the various
import/export operations. This script then gets executed via HTTP. Don't worry
too much about security though: the script is deleted just after the usage,
and can only be executed by `wordmove`, as each time it requires a pre-shared
one-time-password to be run.

## Need more tools?

## Credits

* The dump script is the [`MYSQL-dump` PHP package](https://github.com/dg/MySQL-dump) by David Grudl
* The import script used is the [BigDump](http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump/) library

## Contribute

In order to promote a simpler contribution workflow we have decided to fork and PR the `master` branch.
We will accordingly tag and release or pre-release versions to the rubygems.org repository.
Do not consider the `dev` branch for your forks and PR.
We will never more use version-named branches as in the past, but we'll tag release on `master` and pre-release on `dev`.
