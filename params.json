{"name":"Wordmove","tagline":"Capistrano for Wordpress","body":"# Wordmove\r\n\r\n![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/welaika/wordmove/master/assets/images/wordmove.png)\r\n\r\nWordmove is a gem that lets you automatically mirror local Wordpress\r\ninstallations and DB data back and forth from your local development machine to\r\nthe remote staging server.\r\n\r\n**SSH** connections are fully supported, while [FTP support is planned to be discontinued](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/FTP-support-disclaimer) when new features will be introduced.\r\n\r\nThink of it like Capistrano for Wordpress, complete with push/pull capabilities.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/welaika/wordmove.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/welaika/wordmove)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThat's easy:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install wordmove\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\n> wordmove help\r\nTasks:\r\n  wordmove help [TASK]  # Describe available tasks or one specific task\r\n  wordmove init         # Generates a brand new Movefile\r\n  wordmove pull         # Pulls WP data from remote host to the local machine\r\n  wordmove push         # Pushes WP data from local machine to remote host\r\n```\r\n\r\nMove inside the Wordpress folder and use `wordmove init` to generate a new `Movefile` and edit it with your settings. Read the next paragraph for more info.\r\n\r\nSee the wiki article: [Usage and flags explained](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Usage-and-flags-explained) for more info.\r\n\r\n### Screencasts\r\n\r\n* Push all WordPress, including database and uploads: http://vimeo.com/74648079\r\n* Pull database and uploads, adapting paths and urls: http://vimeo.com/74646861\r\n* Push only theme, transfer only modified files: http://vimeo.com/74647529\r\n\r\n## Movefile\r\n\r\nYou can configure Wordmove creating a `Movefile`. That's just a YAML file with local and remote host infos:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocal:\r\n  vhost: \"http://vhost.local\"\r\n  wordpress_path: \"/home/john/sites/your_site\" # use an absolute path here\r\n\r\n  database:\r\n    name: \"database_name\"\r\n    user: \"user\"\r\n    password: \"password\"\r\n    host: \"127.0.0.1\"\r\n\r\nproduction:\r\n  vhost: \"http://example.com\"\r\n  wordpress_path: \"/var/www/your_site\" # use an absolute path here\r\n\r\n  database:\r\n    name: \"database_name\"\r\n    user: \"user\"\r\n    password: \"password\"\r\n    host: \"host\"\r\n    # port: \"3308\" # Use just in case you have exotic server config\r\n\r\n  exclude:\r\n    - \".git/\"\r\n    - \".gitignore\"\r\n    - \".sass-cache/\"\r\n    - \"bin/\"\r\n    - \"tmp/*\"\r\n    - \"Gemfile*\"\r\n    - \"Movefile\"\r\n    - \"wp-config.php\"\r\n    - \"wp-content/*.sql\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe warmly **recommend** to read the wiki article [Multiple environments explained\r\n](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Multiple-environments-explained) if you need multi-stage support, and the wiki article [Movefile configurations explained](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Movefile-configurations-explained) to understand about the supported configurations.\r\n\r\n## Supports\r\n### OS\r\n\r\nOS X and Linux are fully supported.\r\n\r\nSee the [Windows (un)support disclaimer](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Windows-(un)support-disclaimer)\r\n\r\n### SSH\r\n\r\n* You need `rsync` on your machine; as far as we know it's already installed on OS X and Linux.\r\n* if you want to use your SSH public key for authentication,just delete the `production.ssh.password` field in your `Movefile`. Easy peasy.\r\n* writing the password inside the move file was and is somewhat supported, but we discourage this practice in favor of password-less authentication with pub key. Read [here](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/%5Bdeprecated%5D-SSH-password-inside-Movefile) for old informations.\r\n\r\n### FTP\r\n\r\n* You need to install `lftp` on your machine. See community wiki article: [Install lftp on OSX yosemite](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Install-lftp-on-OSX-yosemite)).\r\n* Use the relative FTP path as `production.wordpress_path`\r\n* Use the absolute FTP path as `production.wordpress_absolute_path` (you may need to recover this from the `__FILE__` [magic constant](http://php.net/manual/en/language.constants.predefined.php)\r\n* if you want to specify a passive FTP connection add to the YAML config a `production.ftp.passive` flag and set it to `true`.\r\n\r\n### Multistage\r\n\r\nYou can define multiple environments in your `Movefile`, such as production, staging, etc.\r\nUse `-e` with `pull` or `push` to run the command on the specified environment.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nwordmove push -e staging -d\r\n```\r\nwill push your local database to the staging environment only.\r\n\r\nWe warmly **recommend** to read the wiki article: [Multiple environments explained\r\n](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove/wiki/Multiple-environments-explained)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n### How the heck you are able to sync the DB via FTP?\r\n\r\nWe're glad you asked! We basically upload via FTP a PHP script that performs the various\r\nimport/export operations. This script then gets executed via HTTP. Don't worry\r\ntoo much about security though: the script is deleted just after the usage,\r\nand can only be executed by `wordmove`, as each time it requires a pre-shared\r\none-time-password to be run.\r\n\r\n## Need more tools?\r\nVisit [Wordpress Tools](http://wptools.it).\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n* The dump script is the [`MYSQL-dump` PHP package](https://github.com/dg/MySQL-dump) by David Grudl\r\n* The import script used is the [BigDump](http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump/) library\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nIn order to promote a simpler contribution workflow we have decided to fork the `master` branch and PR to the master\r\n`branch`.\r\nWe will accordingly tag and release or pre-release versions to the rubygems.org repository.\r\nDo not consider the `dev` branch for your forks and PR.\r\nWe will never more use version-named branches as in the past.\r\n\r\nFeel free to open an issue about contribution if more you need more info\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2013-2015 weLaika\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the ‘Software’), to deal in\r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\r\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\r\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\r\nsubject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ‘AS IS’, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\r\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
